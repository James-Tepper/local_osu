# LOS (Local osu! server)

**Purpose**

LOS aims to simulate the experience of playing on the official osu! server (bancho). It provides features like leaderboards and rankings, while also offering unique functionalities not found on bancho. This includes the ability to rank scores achieved on modified maps using the osutrainer application (https://github.com/FunOrange/osu-trainer).

**Why LOS?**

I was restricted on osu! in 2018. This project was born out of a desire to continue enjoying the experience of gaining ranks and improving gameplay without violating any rules while I restricted. Now, with the acquired knowledge, I aim to make that dream a reality for others who might be in a similar situation.
